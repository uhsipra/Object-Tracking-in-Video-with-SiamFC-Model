# Object-Tracking-in-Video-with-SiamFC-Model

This report showcases the potential of the SiamFC network for object tracking use cases. Object tracking can be a
specialized deep learning approach where an algorithm's main goal is to track the movement of an object, which
entails detecting the specified target object in the first frame of a video and tracking the target object in the
remainder of the video.

The report contains extensive research into similarity learning and the siamese neural network (SNN) architecture. 
The report also contains background information about deep learning and back propagation so anyone can quickly
understand the fundamentals and move onto the specifics of the report.

I hope this report helped with understanding the SiamFC model and object tracking.
